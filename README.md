For completion of requirements for Creative Programming for Digital 
Media & Mobile Apps at Coursera.

It will start off in the "Earth State". Clicking on the screen will
unpause the video and play the audio. Clicking and dragging the mouse
along the height will change the state. If the mouse is dragged to the
bottom part of the screen, it transitions to the "Warp State". Both
states have different animations, as well as different audio.

##Earth State
* Video - spinning earth
* partnersinrhyme.com/video/video/7596.html
* Speeds up as mouse approaches the right side of screen, slows down
in the middle, and reverses at the left side of the screen
* Audio - low humming engine
* freesound.org/people/AniCator/sounds/100482/
* Normal speed at the edges of screen, almost stopped at the middle

##Warp State
* Video - yellow warp
* partnersinrhyme.com/video/video/7583.html
* Audio - warping sound
* freesound.org/people/Erokia/sounds/185844/
* Both audio and video speed up as the mouse approaches the middle
horizontally.

Positioning the mouse in the middle vertically will show a transition
between the two states.

Clicking again while the sketch is playing will pause the video and
audio. Clicking yet again will resume playback.
